# React Nano Degree - Jason Amidan

## My Reads - a Udacity Nano Degree Project

My reads is a react application that allows the user to maintain a list of books that they have: read, would like to read or are currently reading.\

Users can also search the database for book that they would like to add to thier list.\

User lists are maintained in the cloud and will persist if they access the list from the same device.\

## Future Enhancments 

This application could be expanded to support User Authentication which would allow the user to access the list from any device.\

## Appreciation

Thanks to all of the instructors at Udacity for providing the course material, guidance and support.\
